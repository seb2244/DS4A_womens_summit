# DS4A_womens_summit
Contains all project files created during my attendance at Correlation One's Data Science 4 All Women's Summit. Our overall project was to compare and contrast the Airbnb short-term rental market with traditional rent markets. I was mainly in charge of finding and cleaning NYC rent data, performing some preliminary time series analyses, and creating plots to showcase these time series for our capstone presentation.
